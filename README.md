# PassingScoreAPI
This program works by accepting an arg as input, 
the input is then sent to the ScoreManagerClass which will take that 
value and evaluate it's value through the passingScore method. If it is greater than or equal to 6
the method will return true and if not false will be returned.

Exceptions thrown will be caught through numberFormatException and displayed an error message as well as
display error in the returning string.
